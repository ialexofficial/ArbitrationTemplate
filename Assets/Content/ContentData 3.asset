  <Text>k__BackingField: In the complex world of management consulting, House of
    Lies offers a refreshingly satirical take on corporate America. With an ensemble
    cast led by the cunning Marty Kaan (Don Cheadle), the show delves into the morally
    ambiguous lives of these consultants as they manipulate their clients for personal
    and professional gain.
