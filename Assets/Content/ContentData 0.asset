  <Text>k__BackingField: "Adriano Leite Ribeiro (born February 17, 1982), commonly
    known simply as Adriano, is a Brazilian former professional footballer. A powerful
    striker known for his long range left footed strikes, Adriano's career was however
    marked by inconsistency. One of the best strikers in the world in the mid 2000s,
    he had five prolific seasons in Italy with Parma and Inter Milan, earning the
    nickname L'Imperatore (the Emperor), before a decline in his performances which
    coincided with the death of his father. Adriano won four Scudetti for Inter Milan,
    and after moving back to his native Brazil he won two Brasileir\xE3o for Flamengo
    and Corinthians. Making his Brazil debut at 18, Adriano was considered the long-term
    successor to Ronaldo."
